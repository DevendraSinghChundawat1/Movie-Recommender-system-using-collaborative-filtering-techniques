# Movie Recommender system using collaborative filtering technique
In this project we provide an example of a movie recommender system with collaborative filtering technique.

We illustrated how to build a model based collaborative filtering recommender system on Python.

Implemented Stochastic Gradient Descent for minimizing the cost function.

Used the model to make recommendations for the user.
